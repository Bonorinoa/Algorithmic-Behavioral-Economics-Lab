Project 1

Replicating 15 small scale societies behavioral traits with LLMs. 
- Obtain eHRAF cultures data programmatically.
- Build Langchain Agent that collects relevant information about a given society.
- Engineer prompt using eHRAF data and the information collected by the Agent.
   - System prompt should use the information to describe, in detail, the relevant personality/behavioral traits the LLM must adopt.
   - Instruction prompt (let's call it experiment prompt) should contain the action we want it to take. I think these should be the experiments, but it may be smart to think of a template to help with replicability. 
   - The full prompt running an experiment is the concatenation of the two prompts.
-  We must create a new google colab to work on the code for the project. Make sure to keep it well documented and clean. We use a DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) style to improve clarity of the code.
